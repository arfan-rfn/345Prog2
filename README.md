1. All the files required for the project to successfully compile and execute are in the folder: gandhi_uddin_implementationhw2
2. By Default, program starts with a selectInput() instruction allowing the user to select the file to extract and plot the points from.
3. The user also has a dedicated selectInput button that will allow the user to import a new file; there is a default file configured incase the user choses not to import a file or selectInput doesn't work, there is still a file to work with.
